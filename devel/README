Developer and experimental codes for FINUFFT
--------------------------------------------

For generating kernel coefficient codes in ../src,
the developer must run from MATLAB the following:

gen_all_horner_C_code.m          : writes C-style Horner coeffs (pre-2024)
  (you must rerun with upsampfac=2 and 1.25)
gen_all_horner_cpp_header.m      : writes C++ header Horner coeffs (7/2024 on)
  (you must rerun with upsampfac=2 and 1.25)

Both these call for the solve of the coeffs for each w:
ker_ppval_coeff_mat.m
  (which has the kernel definition in it, which must match spreadinterp.cpp)
  The self-test for this last code is a good place to tweak the degree vs w.
